INSTALL: Extract SandyHelipad into your resources folder.  Add start SandyHelipad to server.cfg

OPTIONAL:  I have included an updated config file for LegacyFuel script.  (You can find LegacyFuel at: https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-esx-non-esx-legacyfuel-system/148442 (Credit: InZIdiUZ))
 
To Update config: Copy config.lua included in this package in the LegacyFuelChanges folder to LegacyFuel script folder.  Select copy and replace.
